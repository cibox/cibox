CIBox is an open source tool, that allows you to configure CI workflow in few minutes. CIBox created mostly for DevOps and for users who are familiar with technologies.

## Technologies
We are using a lot of technologies inside CIBox. Main tools in CIBox is Ansible. Also we're using Jenkins as a continuous integration server and a lot of other technologies. Just go through source code if you want to know what is under the hood of CIBox.

## CIBox parts
CIBox allows you to start new project from scratch. In order to make this process smoother and easier, we can distinguish 3 parts of the CIBox.

#### Provisioner

Provisioner gives you ability to configure continuous integration server in a few minutes. CI server can generate builds for your project, make deployments, backups and other maintenance tasks.

#### Vagrant box
Vagrant box gives you ability to work with project locally with the same configuration as your primary(production) environment.
