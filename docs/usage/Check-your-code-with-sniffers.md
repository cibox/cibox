Check your code with sniffers
=====

To check your code with sniffers use `runsniffers.sh` command within `/var/www/docroot` directory.
If you do not want to update software every time and save your time, please use `-n` argument. *Note*, the first run of the command should be without any arguments to download the dependencies.
Example:
```
./runsniffers.sh -n
```
