This repo consists basically from two playbooks

- github.yml repo builder with drupal, vagrant, puppet, drupal pp installation profile, scripts for reinstalling and sniffing with sniffers

You have to use *64bit* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or 14.04 LTS systems for CI server

Common and base apps and packages
=====
cibox-misc role contains all basic packages required for cibox and vagrant installation.

ansible-playbook jenkinsbox.yml --tags "ansible-jetty-solr"
```

=====

```sh
ansible-playbook jenkinsbox.yml --tags "php-stack"
```

run them as
```sh
ansible-playbook jenkinsbox.yml --tags "TAGNAME"
```

OpenVZ support
=====

If your system build on OpenVZ stack and swap is disabled you may bypass
it with using fakeswap.sh file within files/fakeswap directory

for use this script run on remote system console
```sh
chmod a+x fakeswap.sh
```
and
```sh
sh ./fakeswap.sh 4086
```
for adding 4086MB swap size

Within a roles/ subfolder there are roles, been imported from some projects but
not used by default

- cibox-phpdaemon: - role from HP project for installing phpdaemon
- ansible-role-php-pecl: - role, originally developed by geerlingguy but without
 dependency from his php playbook. Can be used for installing pecl packages.
